# Studying Without Borders

Studying Without Borders is committed to higher education in conflict areas. We award scholarships to needy students, contribute to the improvement of the education infrastructure, and raise the awareness of the German public for the situation in our target areas.

With our work, we want to support young people in independently contributing to the reconstruction and reconciliation in their home countries. Together with our scholarship holders, we want to make a contribution to the peaceful and sustainable development in countries and regions that suffer from war or its consequences.
